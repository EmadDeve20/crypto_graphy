You can encrypt a message with this program and open it again.
This program works as follows for encryption:
 You enter your message and then give it a key from 1 to 26, which causes each letter to go forward by the number of those keys and create a hidden message.
Example:
Emad becomes 1 fnbe with the key

The plus version goes one after the first letter and the negative version one less.
For example, Emad in the pluses version becomes with the key one: fodh

You can do this to run Python files:
python ".name Filename .py"
(Of course, you must first install Python)

And to use C files, if you do not know how to research them, you have to compile them (depending on the operating system you are using).

My description of Ramzarz is not complete and accurate and you can do more research on this
